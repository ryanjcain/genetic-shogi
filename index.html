  <p>
  Shogi, also known as Japanese chess, is a two-player strategy board game that sees origins of play as early as 1210. The game is played on a 9x9 grid (as opposed to an 8x8 grid for standard chess) with 8 types of starting pieces (King, Rook, Bishop, Gold General, Silver General, Knight, Lance, and Pawn) as shown above (traditional pieces on the left, westernized on the right).
  </p>

  <p>
  The aspects that separate shogi from chess are the ability to promote multiple piece types and the ability to drop captured pieces back into play. These rules result in a significantly
  larger branching factor than chess, meaning that there are a total of 10<sup>226</sup> possible playouts of a shogi game, compared to just 10<sup>123</sup> for chess.
  </p>

  <p>This project approaches the problem by trying to use genetic algorithms to evolve a set of weights used in a heuristic function to evaluate board positions. The methodology follows
  a paper that used similar approaches to achieve a grandmaster level play for a chess program: <a href="original_chess_ga_paper.pdf"><em>Genetic Algorithms for Evolving Computer Chess</em></a>.
  I attempt to build off of a framework I built in a previous semester and follow the three step process outlined in this paper. First, a set of parameters for 
  a heuristic function is generated based on samples of grandmaster games. Second, the process is repeated to generate multiple candidates before they compete in a coevolution phase 
  to produce a single best set of parameters. Lastly, they evolve a set of parameters used in common selective search algorithms.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  Based on the game features I implemented, I was able to find some success in tuning the parameters of a heuristic function, with my best organisms correctly matching the grandmaster
  move over 17 percent of the time in a 1-ply search. The target achieved in the paper mentioned above was 30 percent; however, given that state-space complexity of shogi is orders of 
  magnitude larger than chess, 17 percent accuracy in a depth one search is still a success. This is also the case when considering that the top performing shogi agents use heuristics 
  comprised of millions of features, compared to just the roughly 60 I used for this project.
